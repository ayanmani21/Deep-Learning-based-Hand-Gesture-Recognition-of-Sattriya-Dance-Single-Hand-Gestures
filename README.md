Sattriya Dance or Sattriya Nritriya is a type of Indian classical dance that dates back to
the 15th century A.D.. Mahapurusha Sankaradev, a revered Assamese saint and reformer,
founded it. The Sattras or Vaishnava monasteries nurtured and preserved the dancing form
as it developed over time. Recognition of hand gestures is developing into an excellent
tool for numerous applications. Thus, this project aims to use the technological prowess
of Hand Gesture Recognition models in recognizing single hand gestures also known as
‘Asamyukta Hastas’ in Sanskrit where ‘asamyukta’ means single and ‘hastas’ mean hand
gesture, of Sattriya Dance. A dataset containing ‘Asamyukta Hastas’ of the Sattriya Dance
was created with the help of a Sattriya Dancer. Using this dataset, a pretrained recognition
model was trained to recognize the gestures in real-time. A web application was developed
for real-time use which implements the whole model and makes it easily accessible.
